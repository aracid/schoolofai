Repository of the AI journey 100 Days of ML Code

## Build an image classifer based on data rendered out of houdini.

I will be building data using PDG/TOPS - https://www.sidefx.com/products/pdg/

### Day 1 - 24/06/2019 - Implemented PyTorch
Trained Using data that was rendered out of houdini and PDG


## Day 2 - 06/08/2019 - Keras
Decided to head back to Keras because there were a flurry of yolo3 demonstrations that showcased its application on coco and various datasets but it was easier to implement a ssd multibox detector using this repo:
